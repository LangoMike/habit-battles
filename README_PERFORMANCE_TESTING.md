# Performance Testing Setup - Quick Start

## 🚀 What's Been Added

Your habit tracker app now has built-in performance testing to verify your resume claims:
> **"220 ms median write → UI refresh and p95 < 1.0 s during user check-ins"**

## 📁 New Files Created

- `src/lib/performanceMetrics.ts` - Performance tracking utilities
- `src/components/PerformanceTester.tsx` - Built-in performance tester UI
- `scripts/performance-test.js` - Automated browser testing
- `scripts/setup-test-data.js` - Test data setup
- `PERFORMANCE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing guide

## ⚡ Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev puppeteer
   ```

2. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test manually:**
   - Go to `/habits` page
   - Scroll down to "Performance Metrics Tester"
   - Click "Start Test"
   - Perform 5-10 habit check-ins
   - Click "Stop Test" to see results

## 🔬 Automated Testing

1. **Setup test data:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:test-data
   ```

2. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:performance
   ```

## 📊 What You'll See

- **Real-time metrics** during testing
- **Median performance** (target: < 220ms)
- **P95 performance** (target: < 1000ms)
- **Pass/Fail indicators** for your resume claims
- **Detailed measurements** for analysis

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your performance testing passes when:
- ✅ Median < 220ms
- ✅ P95 < 1000ms
- ✅ Real-time updates work consistently

## 📝 For Your Resume

Document your actual results:
```
• Delivered real-time UX with [X]ms median write→UI refresh and p95 < [Y]ms 
  during user check-ins by subscribing to Supabase Postgres change feeds and 
  batching list refreshes (tested with [Z]+ measurements)
```
