# Habit Battles

**"Fight the old you. Build the new you."**

A production-ready, real-time habit tracking webapp that combines personal accountability with social competition. Users create habits with weekly targets, track daily check-ins, maintain streaks, and compete with friends in weekly battles based on completion rates.

## **Project Impact**

As a kid, I was obsessed with building. Legos, forts, K’Nex, even Scratch games, you name it, my hand were probably on it. I remember never knowing exactly how things would turn out, but that uncertainty and hands-on learning was what made it exciting. That same drive is why I chose computer science: to build.

By the time I worked through courses in OOP, DSA, math, math, math, and the fundamentals, I learned the technical base. I could implement a quadtree in Java, build web pages with HTML/CSS, use Git, and design SQL tables. But I still didn’t know how to put it all together into something real. That gap gave me serious imposter syndrome. I knew I had the skills, but without actually building something end-to-end, it didn’t feel like I did.

This project changed that. I started with zero knowledge of the tech stack, no clue how to structure a full application, and just began. Step by step, I learned the tools, solved problems, and saw it come together. It wasn’t always smooth (looking at you, ESLint), but it was fun and rewarding in a way that reminded me why I started coding in the first place.

Finishing this project gave me back that spark I had before diff eq. Now I know I can take an idea, figure it out, and make it real. Excited to see what the future holds.. Onto the next project :)
